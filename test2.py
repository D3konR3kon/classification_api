- The hashtags "MAGA" and "Trump" rank as the first and third most frequently used hashtags in anti-climate change tweets, respectively. "MAGA," which stands for "Make America Great Again," originated as Donald Trump's campaign slogan during the 2016 elections. On Twitter, it became a rallying cry for his supporters, symbolized by the hashtag "#MAGA" and associated with support for Trump. This suggests that a significant portion of anti-climate change tweets stem from individuals who align with Trump's ideology.

- Additionally, "DrainTheSwamp" appears among the top anti-climate change hashtags. Trump popularized this phrase as a metaphor for his plan to address corruption within the federal government. During his presidential campaign, he vowed to address issues such as raising taxes on the wealthy, including hedge fund managers. The presence of this hashtag further reinforces the notion that many Trump supporters on Twitter also express anti-climate change sentiments.

- Further down the list, "TCOT" (Top Conservative On Twitter) holds the sixth position. This term serves as a means for conservatives, particularly Republicans, to connect with like-minded individuals on the platform. This trend underscores a recurring pattern of themes associated with Trump's presidency and conservative viewpoints.

- Finally, hashtags like "FakeNews" and "ClimateScam" also garner significant attention. These hashtags may be employed by individuals who oppose the concept of climate change to discredit information and sources they perceive as biased or inaccurate.""")

                        ### Observations:

- The top 3 buzzwords accross all classes are climate change and rt (retweet). The frequency of rt ( Retweet ) means that a lot of the same information and/or opinions are being shared and viewed by large audiences. This is true for all 4 classes

- 'Trump' is a frequently occuring word in all 4 classes. This is unsurprising given his controversial view on the topic.

- Words like real, believe, think, fight, etc. occur frequently in pro climate change tweets. In contrast, anti climate change tweets contain words such as 'hoax', 'scam', 'tax', 'liberal'and 'fake'. There is a stark difference in tone and use of emotive language in these 2 sets of tweets. From this data we could reason that people who are anti climate change believe that global warming is a 'hoax' and feel negatively towards a tax‚Äìbased approach to slowing global climate change

- words like 'science' and 'scientist' occur frequently as well which could imply that people are tweeting about scientific studies that support their views on climate change.

- EPA, the United States Environmental Protection Agency is another climate change 'buzzword' that appears frequently across classes.
